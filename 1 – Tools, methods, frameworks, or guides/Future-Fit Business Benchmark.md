# Overview
The Future-Fit Business Benchmark is an online tool consisting of principles, goals, indicators and guides. The approach is based on a solid, principles-driven definition of an ideal society for the future: a society where waste is eliminated, individuals have the chance and capability to lead fulfilling lives, renewable energy is accessible to everyone, and so forth. The set of 23 Break-Even Goals operationalize these principles by establishing minimum performance benchmarks that every business should aim to achieve. Furthermore, the 24 Positive Pursuits encompass the comprehensive spectrum of outcomes a business can contribute to accelerate societal progress. The Break-Even Goals come with a set of progress indicators, each quantified as a percentage. These indicators are crafted to assist businesses in recognizing risks, establishing interim targets, prioritizing actions, anticipating trade-offs, and monitoring progress..

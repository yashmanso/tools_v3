# Overview
[The Impact Compass](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/about/centers-institutes/csi/impact-compass) is an analytical tool created by the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford University, designed to help individuals and organizations evaluate and maximize their social impact. It focuses on six key dimensions: value to society, environmental and social governance, mission alignment, scalability, impact magnitude, and efficacy. This tool is particularly useful for decision-making processes where the goal is to determine the most effective allocation of resources towards activities that generate positive social outcomes. The idea is to conform to three main principles: no proven failure, no negative societal outcome, and no unethical behavior. These three main principles are called the Three Big No’s. The goal for organizations is to clear the Three Big No’s and they maximize their impact by working with the six dimensions, each contributing to the overall evaluation of an entity’s impact potential.

**Methodological approach:**
The Impact Compass is based on a theoretical framework that draws from extensive literature and expert insights in the field of social innovation. The six dimensions are multiplied together, rather than simply added up, to obtain an impact potential score, which represents the interactive power of each dimension on one another.

**Collaboration level:**
The tool can be used by individuals or teams within organizations to collaboratively assess and plan for social impact. But for meaningful outcomes, the tool suggests a cross-functional team effort that ideally also seeks input from the targeted community itself. This makes collaboration across disciplines, departments, and among diverse stakeholders essential.
